# CS-370-Emerging-Trends-in-CS
Projects from Current/Emerging Trends in CS
# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
  * In this project I performed different functions when it comes to neural networks and reinforcement learning. I created an intellgient agent that was able to learn from the environment that I created and tested the solutions to these problems. I was given the intial code to create an intelligent agent and environment and I created the training algorithm which made it possible for the agent to see and interact with the maze.
# Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
  * The connection of this class to computer science is instituted throught the entire course. The use of reinforcment learning and neural networks in a career path that works with machine learning goes hand in hand. 
# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
  * As a computer scientist, algorithms and data structures are used to create solutions to problems. These skills learned in this class are indispensible in the field.
# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
  * As a computer scientist I approach problems in a manner that is organized and thoughtful. After realizing what the problem is, a computer scientist then researches the problem, develops a plan, uses the solution, and then tests the solution.
# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
  * The greatest ethical resposibility to the end user and the organization is compliance with the law. The industy has guiderails in place to stop the creator from devulging user information or from giving into pressure to reveal organization secrets.
